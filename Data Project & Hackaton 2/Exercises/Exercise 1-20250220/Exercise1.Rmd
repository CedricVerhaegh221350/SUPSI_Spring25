# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. The text below is the same as the filler you obtain when you create a new notebook. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Scalar operations

Try the following operations in R, assign the results to appropriate variables

* `4+3` assign the result to the variable `a`
* `a^2` assign the result to `b`
* `b` divided by 2
* `b` integer division by 2
* `b` modulo 2, assign the result to `c`
* Return a boolean that is `TRUE` if `c` is equal to zero

```{r}
# Write your solutions here

c <- 1

bool_c <- c==1

```


## Vectors

### Pointwise operations

Build two vectors that contain measurements `x=[0.05, 1.51, -0.36, -0.14, 1.31, 0.11, -1.56, 0.13, -0.40, -0.31 ]` and use vector operations to compute

* the mean of `x`;
* the length of `x`;
* the empirical variance of `x` defined as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2$

```{r}
# Write your solutions here
```

### Sequences and repeated vectors

Use the functions `seq` and `rep` to generate

* the vector of powers of two from 1 to 256
* the vector `[1  2  3 11 12 13 21 22 23 31 32 33]` 

```{r}
seq(0,8)
2^seq(0,8)
```


### Vector multiplications

Build the vectors `a= [3,2,1]` and `b=[2,-3,0]` and perform the following operations

* `a^T b`
* the outer product of `a` and `b`

```{r}
# Write your solutions here
```

## Matrices

Create the following matrix 

$S= \begin{bmatrix}
1   & 0.5 & 0.9 \\
0.5 & 1   & 0.7 \\
0.9 & 0.7 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$

and evaluate the following with R functions

* determinant of S
* trace of S (compose functions)
* the inverse of S
* given the vector `a=[1,2,3]`, compute `a^T S^{-1} a`

```{r}
# Write your solutions here
```


## Lists and dataframes

Create a list `x` that contains

* the sequence of numbers from 2 to 5 
* the string "Rolling Stones"
* the boolean `FALSE`
* another list that contains a vector with numbers 6 to 7 and the number 10
Access the boolean value by using the brakets notation

```{r}
# Write your solutions here
```


### Data frames
* Build a dataset of TV series with the following attributes *Title*, *Year*, *Network* of size at least 4 and store it in a data.frame. 
* Use the function `order` (see documentation) to obtain the ordering of the tv series by year
* Extract the oldest TV series in the data frame by using the bracket notation and by using the function `head`

```{r}
# Write your solutions here
```

### Working with data frames

Cosider now the data frame `swiss` which is automatically loaded when opening R.

* look up the first entries with the function `head`, what do you think it is about?
* Use the help function to find more details on the data.
* Use the function `dim` to find out how many instances and how many features the data has.
* Use a for loop with an if statement to choose only the instances with the feature `Catholic`>50.
  - You can create an empty data frame with the function `data.frame()`
  - You can "append" a new row to the data frame with the function `rbind`
* Can you use obtain the same dataset with one line of code? Think about subsetting by evaluating an expression.

```{r}
# Write your solutions here
```
